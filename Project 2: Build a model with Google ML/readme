## Introduction

This is the second project as part of the Udacity AI Product Manager Nanodegree Program

In this project, we are going to build the classification model that would serve as the backbone of this product. 
To do so, an automated machine learning tool called Google AutoML will be used. It allows us to build the model and host it in the cloud. 
In order to appreciate how training data impact models, we will build models with 4 variants of the dataset. 

## Aim of the project is to test ability to

1. build a model using Google's AutoML Vision platform, and
2. understand how properties of data impact performance of models.
